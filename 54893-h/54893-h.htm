<h2><a name="In_the_Harem" id="In_the_Harem"></a>In the Harem.</h2>


<p>Many people have an idea that Turkish
women absolutely do nothing that is either
useful or ornamental aside from the decoration
of their own persons, but that is not altogether
true, as my residence of over a year in their
country taught me, for they are really dextrous
with the needle and do work which is as fine as
that done by the sisters in the convents, or that
of the wives of the feudal noblemen of olden
times.</p>

<p>The favorite pastime of the Turkish women
is the bath, which brings together the wives
and slaves of all the well-to-do Turks, and it is
like a picnic of school children.</p>

<p>These wives, most of them very young&mdash;some,
indeed, not over twelve or fourteen years
old&mdash;take their lunch along, and they eat and
steam, plunge and splash, and play pranks
upon each other in the wildest glee the whole
day long. No fear of an angry husband
haunts their minds, for they are not expected
to do anything, and their husbands very rarely
enter the harems before six o’clock. By this
time they are all back, rosy and sweet from
their bath.</p>

<p>At the baths there is often an old woman
who has the faculty of relating stories, and she
is eagerly listened to by the grown-up children;
the stories are generally of the Arabian nights
order, full of genii, beautiful ladies, and
charming youths and jealous husbands. Many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a lesson is given as how to outwit the most
jealous of men through these stories&mdash;a lesson
they are neither slow to learn nor practise.</p>

<p>The way they are watched and confined always
made me think of the woman who cautioned
her innocent children not to put blue
beans in their noses while she was out. The
magic lantern entertainments amuse these ignorant
caged birds. Dancing girls, singing and
playing the lute, playing with the babies and
occasionally quarrelling with each other take
up some of their time; a weekly tour of the
bazaars and once in a while a visit to the
harem of some other Turk, still leave much
time on their hands that the rare calls of their
husbands, the eating of sweetmeats or smoking
of cigarettes cannot fill, and so they give
their poor little minds to fancy work. They
very seldom learn how to read, or perhaps
books would help them through, and they
never make their own clothes, though they do
sometimes decorate them very elaborately after
others have made them.</p>

<p>They have frames made on which their embroidery
is worked, and on velvet, satin or that
beautiful and durable Broussa gauze they embroider
with exquisite fineness and taste.
The most of their embroidery is done in durable
and admirably-arranged colors, in subdued
tones, which seem to me remarkable in
women who are so fond of brilliant primary
colors and ill-assorted contrasts. They have
no patterns, but work out graceful and beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
fantasies, and all done with the most extreme
care and fineness, requiring patience and
extra good eyesight.</p>

<p>We might suppose that these women would
take pleasure in making and embroidering
their babies’ clothes as do other women, but as
babies are simply swathed in endless rollers,
like a mummy, until they are six months old,
ornament is unnecessary. At the end of six
months boy babies are put into pantaloons and
girls into loose trousers, both being usually
made of large flowered chintz.</p>

<p>About the only thing I ever noticed the
Turkish women do for their little children was
to make toys for them, and they make the
most grotesque-looking dogs, lions, cows, rabbits,
elephants, camels and doll babies out of
rags for their amusement. They never nurse
their babies for fear of spoiling the shape of
the bust. They are very poor mothers, as they
are too ignorant themselves to understand their
responsibilities or to teach their children.
They alternately slap them or caress and indulge
them just as their own humor happens to
be good or bad.</p>

<p>The little girls are taught to sew and embroider,
how to walk gracefully, and recline in
the most negligent manner upon the divans,
how to play by ear a little on the lute, and to
sing their interminable love songs. Their
songs are like Barbara Allen, Lovely Young
Caroline of Edinboro Town, the Brown Girl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
or Gipsy Dave&mdash;all long, and telling a whole
romance to a plaintive chant.</p>

<p>I never learned to speak Turkish, but I got
so that I could seize upon the meaning of these
songs. The singer always puts all the life and
sentiment she can into her music, and often
sheds tears as she sings, as do her listeners. I
have even seen one or two of them faint away
at the most pathetic part. This is a very common
trait among Turkish women, and I have
not yet been able to decide whether it is the
result of a weak will or extreme sensibility, but
they faint on every possible occasion.</p>

<p>The Turkish women love music passionately,
and nearly all of them can play some instrument
with taste and feeling, though almost
always by ear. Their native music is always
sad and plaintive, and often full of such a
piercing sorrow that it is no wonder it brings
tears. They love flowers, too, and you rarely
see one without a flower in her hand when it is
possible to get them, and they are fond of
birds, and raise a great many themselves.
Many of the Turkish women show considerable
talent in drawing and painting, though the
poor things never have any chance to learn.
They simply “pick it up.”</p>

<p>As I found the Turkish women&mdash;and I happened
to have obtained, by a fortunate circumstance,
a chance to know them in their homes
accorded to very few foreign women, and to
absolutely no foreign man&mdash;they are gentle,
submissive, loving, and with many natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gifts in addition to their beauty. If they were
educated they would be the equal of any
women in Europe.</p>

<p>It does not seem to me that they are unhappy
in their peculiar marriage relations. They reminded
me of a lot of irresponsible young girls
in a boarding-school, and the only jealousy
such as might be felt of the “teacher’s pet.”
Instead of the poisoned and vindictive murder
I supposed always ready to be inflicted upon
each other, the worst they ever do is to pull
each other’s hair occasionally or box each
other’s ears.</p>

<p>Girls reach their majority at nine and are frequently
married a year later, though not usually
until fifteen. By that time all the education
they get is acquired. Instead of being
taught all the abstruse sciences she is taught
all the caressing words and gestures possible to
imagine&mdash;how to walk, sit, look and speak so as
to appear the most seductive in the eyes of the
husband who gets her.</p>

<p>No Turkish wife of the better class is ever
expected to do any domestic labor whatever,
nor to make any of the household linen, nor
any garments for herself or members of the
household, nor to sew any buttons on, nor,
above all, to make her husband’s shirts; therefore
it can be seen at once that almost every
source of domestic disagreement is done away
with, and the Turkish husband never expects
his wife to get on her knees to hunt for his
collar button, nor scold her if the dinner is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
badly cooked; so that in many respects life in
a harem is not so very bad after all, and one-tenth
of a good husband is better than the
whole of a bad one.</p>

<h2><a name="Secrets_of_the_Harem" id="Secrets_of_the_Harem"></a>Secrets of the Harem.</h2>


<p>The harem is that part of a polygamist’s
house which is set apart for the use of his
wives and their attendants; it also denotes this
collective body of women. In all Mohammedan
countries it is customary for wealthy men
to keep a harem; for, though four is the number
of wives to which the faithful are restricted
by the Koran, there is no limit to the number
of concubines a man may have, except his
ability to maintain them. The mention of a
harem naturally suggests to most people the
female portion of the royal households of Turkey
and Persia and Egypt. In the sultan’s
harem each wife&mdash;he alone can have seven&mdash;has
a separate suite of apartments, and a separate
troop of female slaves to wait upon her
and do her bidding.</p>

<p>All the female slaves or odalisques throughout
the harem are, however, at the disposal of
their royal master. She who first gives birth
to an heir, whether wife or slave, is instantly
promoted to the rank of chief wife. The title
sultana is borne, not by the sultan’s wives,
but by his mother, sisters and daughters. The
real ruler of the harem is the sultan’s mother,
but under her is the lady superintendent of the
harem, usually an old and trusted favorite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the sultan. The duties of guarding the harem
or seraglio, as it is sometimes called, are intrusted
to a small army of eunuchs, the chief
officer of whom generally enjoys considerable
political influence. The inmates of the harem
lead a very secluded life.</p>

<div class="chapter"></div><!--Page break for ePub-->
<h2><a name="The_Sultans_Seraglio" id="The_Sultans_Seraglio"></a>The Sultan’s Seraglio.</h2>


<p>Seraglio is the palace of the sultan at Constantinople.
It stands in a beautiful situation
on a head of land projecting into the sea,
known as the Golden Horn, and is enclosed by
walls seven and one-half miles in circuit.
Within the walls are a variety of mosques, gardens
and large edifices, capable of containing
20,000 people, though the whole number of the
inhabitants scarcely ever reaches the half of
this.</p>

<p>The principal entrance is a kind of pavilion,
which is constantly guarded by capidjis, or
officers of the seraglio, and consists of a group
of houses and gardens, one of each being possessed
by each of the sultan’s wives, and of the
habitations of the concubines and slaves.</p>

<p>The harem is ruled by the Kiaja-Khatun, or
inspector of the women, who is under the sultan’s
authority alone, and is supplied with
what they require by the Kislar-aga or chief of
the black eunuchs, who form the principal or
inner guard of the harem. The second and
outer guard is given to the white eunuchs under
their chief the Kapu-agassy, or Kapu-oghlan.</p>

<p>Other classes of household officers are the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
mutes, who, till recently, were the executors of
the sultan’s orders, especially those in which
the utmost secrecy was required; the bostanjis,
or gardeners; the batajis, or clearers of wood;
and the itsh-oghlans, or attendants of the sultan.
The sultan’s mother always resides within
the seraglio, but his sisters do not. Access
may easily be had to the seraglio, with the exception
of the harem, which is scrupulously
guarded from even the eyes of strangers. The
English have improperly confounded the two
terms “seraglio” and “harem.”</p>

<h2><a name="Dervishes" id="Dervishes"></a>Dervishes.</h2>


<p>A Dervish, in Mohammedan countries, is a
class of people resembling in many respects
the monks of Christendom. The dervishes are
divided into many different brotherhoods and
orders. They live mostly in well endowed convents,
called Tekkije or Changah, and are under
a chief with the title of a Sheik. Some of the
monks are married, and allowed to live out of
the monastery, but must sleep there some
nights weekly. Their devotional exercises consist
in meetings for worship, prayers, religious
dances, and mortifications. As the convent
does not provide them with clothing, they are
obliged to work more or less.</p>

<p>It is difficult to say when these religious
orders took their rise. From the earliest times,
pious persons in the East have held it to be
meritorious to renounce earthly joys, to free
themselves from the trammels of domestic and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
social life, and to devote their thoughts in
poverty and retirement to the contemplation of
God. In this sense, poverty is recommended
by Mohammed in the Koran. Tradition refers
to the origin of these orders to the earliest times
of Islam, making the califs Abubekr and Ali
found such brotherhoods; but it is more probable
that they arose later.</p>

<p>Many Mohammedan princes and Turkish
sultans have held dervishes in high respect,
and bestowed rich endowments on their establishments;
and they are still in high veneration
with the people. The Kadris are commonly
known in the West as “the howling dervishes,”
from the excited chant of their religious services;
the “dancing dervishes” are the Mevelevis.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Life_of_Popular_Songs" id="The_Life_of_Popular_Songs"></a>The Life of Popular Songs.</h2>


<p>In the end, a popular song is killed by its
own success; it is sung, played, and whistled
to death. The hand-organs hasten the catastrophe.
It is doubtful whether any popular
song of to-day will have other than an ephemeral
existence, there are so many more people
than there used to be to wear it out. Some of
the songs of forty years ago&mdash;notably, “Swanee
River,” “Old Folks at Home,” and the “Mocking
Bird”&mdash;are still frequently heard, which
cannot be said of the popular songs of more
recent years.</p>

<p>The war for the Union gave birth to quite a
number of good songs, and “Marching through
Georgia” will live as long as a soldier exists.
Soon after the war we had “Silver Threads
Among the Gold” and “Put Me in My Little
Bed,” which were in everybody’s mouth, and
put a great deal of money into the pocket of
their author. But they are seldom heard nowadays;
and the same may be said of “Captain
Jinks of the Hoss Marines,” who fed his horse
on corn and beans, and “Walkin’ Down Broadway.”</p>

<p>It is now some years ago since our ears were
regaled with “Rock-a-Bye, Baby,” “Climbin’
Up the Golden Stairs,” and “See-Saw.” These
were succeeded by “Maggie Murphy’s Home,”
“McGinty,” “Annie Rooney,” the famous
“Ta-ra-ra,” and “Monte Carlo,” which have
already been turned down for “My Sweetheart’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the Man in the Moon,” “Daisy,” and the latest
rage&mdash;“After the Ball.” It is said, by the way,
that the author of the last-mentioned song is
deriving a fortune from it. He has already
cleared more than a popular novelist realizes
from a four hundred page book.</p>

<h2><a name="What_He_Did" id="What_He_Did"></a>What He Did.</h2>


<p>The idea of refusing water to fever patients
is, we are glad to say, nearly a thing of the
past. The following incident, related by a
sailor, serves as an illustration of the water
treatment. “Some years ago, when we were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Jamaica, several of us were sick with the fever,
and among the rest the second mate. The
doctor had been giving him brandy to keep
him up, but I thought it was a queer kind of
‘keeping up.’ Why, you see, it stands to reason
that if you heap fuel on a fire, it will burn
the faster, and putting brandy to a fever is just
the same kind of thing.</p>

<p>“Well, the doctor gave him up, and I was
sent to watch with him. No medicine was left,
for it was no use&mdash;nothing would help him;
and I had my directions what to do with the
body when he was dead. Toward midnight he
asked for some water. I got him the coolest I
could find, and all he wanted; and if you’ll
believe me, in less than three hours he drank
three gallons.</p>

<p>“The sweat rolled from him like rain. Then
I thought sure he was gone; but he was sleeping,
and as sweetly as a child. In the morning
when the doctor came, he asked what time the
mate died.</p>

<p>“‘Won’t you go in and look at him?’ I said.</p>

<p>“He went in and took the mate’s hand.</p>

<p>“‘Why,’ said he, ‘the man is not dead. He’s
alive and doing well. What have you been
giving him?’</p>

<p>“‘Water, simply water, and all he wanted of
it,’ said I.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as the doctor learned anything
from that, but I did.”</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
